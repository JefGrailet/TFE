About TFE repository - By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet, May 28, 2015
=============================================================

This repository contains files related to my master thesis (TFE standing for 
Travail de Fin d'Etude) on "Measuring and Modeling the Internet Graph". It is 
during this master thesis that I conceived and implemented TreeNET, which is 
freely available in the treenet repository along a month worth of meausrements 
collected from the PlanetLab testbed.

However, there are some files which were relevant to my master thesis which 
did not fit in the treenet repository. This is why this side repository was 
created.

This repository contains the following folders:

* Campaign/: contains a bunch of Shell scripts which were used to launch a 
  daily campaign on AS224 with TreeNET and several PlanetLab nodes. They are 
  provided as an example of the typical operations that were done on a daily 
  basis with PlanetLab. The names of the files should be self-explanatory.
  
  Note, however, that several lines in the scripts were based on my own laptop 
  file system (for example for my RSA private key), therefore, if one wants 
  to re-use theses scripts for him or herself, he/she should carefully edit 
  the scripts.

* Evaluation/: contains some console dumps from TreeNET, along the 
  corresponding data sets, which were used as a basis to evaluate the 
  efficiency of some algorithmic steps of TreeNET (i.e. bypass technique and 
  refinement step). The console dumps/data sets are from a measurement 
  campaign on AS3209.
  
* ExploreNET/: contains a single file "Fixes" listing some of the problems of 
  the original ExploreNET (v2.1) which were fixed at the very beginning. This 
  includes some minor issues and memory leaks.

* Python/: a folder containing some Python scripts which were used to plot 
  data collected with TreeNET to highlight some of its characteristics. It is 
  worth noting that the data sets used for the plots found in my master thesis 
  are found in the treenet repository as:
  
  Measurements/AS224/20-04
  Measurements/AS5400/29-03
  
  Each script is commented and isolated with PDF/text files which were 
  produced with it.
